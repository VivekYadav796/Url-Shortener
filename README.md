Basic Backend Url Shoetener Project 
How it works ?
    Firstly user sumit a long url.
    It takes the url and generate a short url .
    Stores short url corresponding with their original long orl in the database.
    It shows the short url to the user.
    If the user click on the short url then in the backend it retrieves the orginal url from the databases of that short url so that the user redirect to the orginal link.

Technologies used ?
    Spring Boot for Backend
    MySQL for Database
    HTML for frontend
